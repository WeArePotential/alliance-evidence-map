How harm reduction programs work in the context of village and commune safety policy: Lessons learned from a national non-governmental organization in Cambodia. ,"This paper aims to examine the challenges and implications of the Village and Commune Safety Policy (VCSP) on harm-reduction programs and describe lessons learned from a harm-reduction program within the context of the VCSP in Cambodia. Data were collected from a monitoring and evaluation database and reports of a drop-in center that provides a wide range of harm-reduction services. In addition, qualitative data were collected through key informant interviews and focus group discussions with 38 participants including people who use drugs (PWUD) and people who inject drugs (PWID). Desk reviews and consultative meetings with key stakeholders were also conducted. In total, 496 PWUD were registered into the program between 2010 and 2012, of which 22.4% were PWID, and 15.0% were women. The mean age of participants was 26 years old. HIV prevalence among PWUD was 1.0% compared to 16.2% among PWID. Remarkable achievements were observed such as high uptake of services by PWUD and PWID with active referrals to methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) and voluntary HIV confidential counseling and testing (VCCT). However, distribution of clean needles and syringes in communities was limited. Also, the newly initiated needle and syringe program (NSP) based in pharmacies failed to reach PWUD and PWID. Appropriate coordination and collaboration with law enforcement and authorities were observed given the complexity of the VCSP. However, the implementation of the VCSP poses challenges including NSP and accessibility to harm reduction services. For future successes of harm-reduction programs, it is important to maintain close coordination and collaboration between program implementers and local authorities with mutual understanding and flexibility.",Research,,Harm Reduction ,Complete,2017,Yi Siyan,KHANA,Cambodia,Journal of Addiction Disorder and Rehabilitation 2017 (in press).,https://openaccesspub.org/jadr/article/641,,Primary study,Internal,en,Y,Open Access,© Sovannary Tuot,No,"Observational (focus groups, interviews; thematic analysis)",PWUD; PWID,11;12;2;7;9;10;17;1;16,"counseling and psycho-social support interventions; Mobilization, education and norms change interventions (incl. behavioural and empowerment interventions); HIV care, testing and treatment (incl. adherence and monitoring) services; diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (other than HIV) and other sexual health services; needle and syringe programs; opiod substitution therapy and other drug dependence treatment / overdose prevention and management programs; other approaches (livelihood development); condoms (male and female) and lubricant programming; interventions aimed to incfluence HIV-related laws policies and practices of policy makers; ","Clinic for Mental Health and Drug

"Patterns of HIV testing, drug use, and sexual behaviors in people who use drugs and people who inject drugs: Findings from a community-based outreach program in Phnom Penh, Cambodia","Background: People who use drugs are an important priority for HIV programs. However, data related to their utilization
of HIV services are limited. This paper reports patterns of HIV testing, drug use, and risk and service perception
among people who use drugs. Study participants were receiving HIV and harm reduction services from a communitybased
program in Phnom Penh, comprised of itinerant peer-led outreach and static drop-in centers.
Methods: This was a mixed-methods study conducted in 2014, comprising of a quantitative survey using a structured
questionnaire, followed by two focus group discussions among a sub-sample of survey participants. Participants
were recruited from hotspots in five HIV high-burden communes using a two-stage cluster sampling method. Quantitative
descriptive analyses and qualitative thematic analyses were performed.
Results: This study included 151 people who use drugs with a mean age of 31.2 (SD = 6.5) years; 77.5% were male
and 39.1% were married. The most common drugs used were methamphetamines (72.8%) and heroin (39.7%), and
38.0% injected drugs in the past 3 months. Overall, 83.3% had been tested for HIV in the past 6 months, of whom
62.5% had been tested by peers through community-based outreach. However, there were ongoing HIV risks: 37.3%
were engaging in sex on drugs, only 35.6% used a condom at last sexual intercourse, and 10.8% had had a sexually
transmitted infection in the last 6 months. Among people who reported injecting drugs in the past 3 months, 27.5%
reported re-using needles/syringes. Almost half (46.5%) perceived themselves as being at lower risk of HIV compared
to the general population. Qualitative results contextualized the findings of low perception of HIV risks and suggested
that although services were often unavailable on weekends, at night, or during national holidays, peer-led community-
based outreach was highly accepted.
Conclusions: A peer-led community-based approach was effective in reaching people who use drugs with HIV and
harm reduction interventions. To mitigate ongoing HIV risks, expanding access to combination prevention interventions
and implementing strategies to enable people who use drugs to objectively assess their HIV risks are required.
Additionally, community-based programs should collect data along the care continuum, to enable decentralized
tracking of progress towards 90–90–90 goals at local levels.",Research,,Harm Reduction ,Completed,2017,Yi Siyan,KHANA,Cambodia,Addiction Science & Clinical Practice 2017 (in press).,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13722-017-0094-9,,Primary study,Internal,en,Y,Open Access,© Mburu et al. ,No,Observational (cross-sectional survey),Key populations; PWUD; PWID,1;9;12;10;11;2,"Condoms (male and female) and lubricant programming; Needle and syringe programs; Mobilization, education and norms change interventions (incl. behavioural and empowerment interventions); Opioid substitutiontherapy and other drug dependencetreatment / Overdose prevention and management programs; Counseling andpsycho-social support interventions; HIV care, testing and treatment (incl. adherence and monitoring) services",,6;11;17;25;28;29,Increased use of voluntary counselling and testing; Increased uptake of sterile injecting equipment; Increased knowledge about HIV; Increased access to voluntary counselling and testing; Increased access to sterile injecting equipment; Increased access to opioid substitution therapy; ,,Moderate
