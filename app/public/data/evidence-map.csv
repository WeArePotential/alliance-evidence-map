"Looking In, Looking Out: A formative evaluation of the LILO KP methodology in Kenya and Zimbabwe","<p>LILO KP is an intervention which aims to sensitise people working with MSM and SW through building empathy with KPs, thus causing shifts in attitude with a view to enhancing HIV programmes and contributing towards advocacy goals. A formative evaluation into the effectiveness of LILO KP in the International HIV/AIDS Alliance (the Alliance)_s partners in Kenya and Zimbabwe was performed in order to inform future iterations of the training. </p><p>Evidence gathered through semi-structured interviews with 20 participants suggests that the training contributed to learning both at the individual level and organizational level. Interviewees described the existence of tensions between their work with KPs and their personal values prior to the training.
